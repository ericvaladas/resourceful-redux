Because\ncommunicating with remote servers requires sending messages over a network,\nreading and writing this state does not happen instantly. The requests take\ntime, and they may sometimes fail.\nThese network requests are often made as a result of a user's action within the\napplication. It's a developer's responsibility to provide feedback to the user\nabout these requests. When using Redux, this means writing reducers that change\nyour store's state tree based on the status of these requests. If your\napplication has many resources, you can run into problems when you write these\nreducers by hand.\nFor one, simply figuring out what information needs to be tracked can be\ndifficult to figure out. Request tracking is a complicated problem.\nWhen you do figure out something that works, it may be implemented slightly\ndifferently for different resources in your state tree. This inconsistency will\npropagate to your view layer. Code bases that are not consistent are more\ndifficult to maintain.\nAdditionally, tracking all of this data for every request requires writing a lot\nof reducer code. You may omit writing some of that code to save on time. This\ncontributes to inconsistency, and also gives you, the developer, less\ninformation to use when providing feedback to users.\nResourceful Redux is intended to solve these problems. It provides a system of\norganizing information about request state in a consistent way. It also comes\nwith reducers that keep track of as much information as possible about every\nrequest made to remote servers, so that you don't have to.\nUse Resourceful Redux to have more time to build great interfaces, rather than\nwriting boilerplate Redux code.\n"},"docs/introduction/core-concepts.html":{"url":"docs/introduction/core-concepts.html","title":"Core Concepts","keywords":"","body":"Core Concepts\nResourceful Redux is intended to be a simple solution to a complicated problem.\nResources\nA resource is an entity that you interact with in your application. For\ninstance, if your web application manages a public library, then you might have\ntwo resources: \"books\" and \"members.\"\nEach instance of a resource has a unique ID, which differentiates it from other\nresources of the same time. They typically also have attributes, such as \"name\"\nor \"releaseYear.\"\nResources don't necessarily need to represent tangible objects. They can be more\nabstract things, too, such as \"workflows\" or \"permissions.\"\nIn Resourceful Redux, each resource will be kept in its own\nslice of\nyour store. Within that slice, all of the resources of a single type are kept in\nan object, where the key of the object is the resource's ID. This looks like the\nfollowing:\n{\n  resources: {\n    24: {\n      // Attributes of book 24\n    },\n    100: {\n      // Attributes of book 100\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nResource Metadata\nIn addition to an ID and attributes, resources have \"metadata\" about them, which\nis additional information about a resource that is useful for your interface.\nFor instance, if your interface displays a list of books that the user can\nselect by clicking checkboxes, then the information about which books are\nselected would be metadata about the books resource.\nA rule of thumb is that metadata is any data about a resource that is not\npersisted to a remote server.\nIn Resourceful Redux, all metadata is stored on an object. This meta object,\nlike the resources object, has resource IDs as its keys, and has values that are\nmetadata. An example is:\n{\n  meta: {\n    24: {\n      // Metadata for book 24\n    },\n    100: {\n      // Metadata for book 100\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nCRUD Operations\nThere are four interactions you can have with a resource: you can create them,\nretrieve them, update them, or delete them. These four operations are\ncollectively known as\nCRUD.\nCRUD Operation Requests\nFor many applications, resources are stored in an external system, and\nCRUD operations with the resources occur over a network. These interactions are\ncalled \"requests.\" Typically, they are HTTP requests.\nBecause requests occur over a network, they do not happen instantly.\nThey might take awhile to complete, and they don't always succeed.\nIn Resourceful Redux, this information is represented as one of four \"statuses\":\n\nNULL: the request hasn't begun yet\nPENDING: the request has started, but has not yet finished\nFAILED: the request was unsuccessful\nSUCCEEDED: the request was successful\n\nIn Resourceful Redux, each individual resource has a request status for each of\nthe four CRUD operations associated with it. This information is the default\nmeta that you get for each resource. If you had one resource with an ID of 24,\nthen your metadata will start off looking like this:\n{\n  meta: {\n    24: {\n      createStatus: 'NULL',\n      readStatus: 'NULL',\n      updateStatus: 'NULL',\n      deleteStatus: 'NULL'\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nResourceful Redux keeps this metadata up-to-date for each resource as users use\nyour app.\nThis reduces the boilerplate code that you need to write, giving you more time\nto build your application.\n"},"docs/introduction/similar-projects.html":{"url":"docs/introduction/similar-projects.html","title":"Similar Projects","keywords":"","body":"Similar Projects\nThis isn't the only library that aims to reduce boilerplate when it comes to\nmanaging resources. Below is a brief comparison between this library and a\nhandful of others.\nKeep in mind that this comparison page is not intended to be complete.\nWe encourage you to look into other options to determine which is the\nbest fit for your use case.\nredux-rest-resource\nredux-rest-resource does not track metadata on a per-resource basis.\nInstead, it merges all metadata for all resources onto a\nsingle property.\nConsider, for instance, if a user decides to save two resources simultaneously.\nResourceful Redux will track those two actions independently, but\nredux-rest-resource will only track that at least one resource is being saved.\nredux-resources\nA short list of things that redux-resources does differently from this library\nis:\n\nresources are split up in the store based on the requests that you make.\nResourceful Redux stores all resources of the same type into one object,\nand provides request labels to organize your resources by requests.\nit does not provide metadata on a per-resource level\nit provides timestamps for the operations that you perform out of the box\nit keeps a cache of errors returned from the server out of the box\n\nThe features of redux-resources that are not included in Resourceful Redux\nwould be straightforward to add in via plugins.\nHowever, getting the level of detail that Resourceful Redux provides for\nrequests appears like it would be difficult to achieve using redux-resources.\nredux-json-api\nredux-json-api provides less detail about individual resource's metadata than\nResourceful Redux: it stores a single number that counts the number of\nconcurrent requests of the same type that are in flight, whereas\nResourceful Redux tracks all requests separately.\nIn addition, redux-json-api requires that your backend adhere to\nJSON API. Although Resourceful Redux does not provide a\ncomplete integration with JSON API out of the box, the plugin system would\nenable you to add more features such as relationship support.\n"},"docs/introduction/examples.html":{"url":"docs/introduction/examples.html","title":"Examples","keywords":"","body":"Examples\nA number of examples are distributed with the library's\nsource code.\nRead Resource\nTo run this example:\ngit clone https://github.com/jmeas/resourceful-redux.git\n\ncd resourceful-redux/examples/read-resource\nnpm install\nnpm start\n\nopen http://localhost:3000/\nThis example shows what the most basic usage of Resourceful Redux looks\nlike.

For instance, it could represent a book, or a person, or something\nmore abstract, like a 'workflow' or 'responsibility.'\nThe only requirement of a resource is that it must have an id\nattribute. The following are some examples of valid resources:\n{\n  id: 23,\n  firstName: 'Bill',\n  lastName: 'Graham',\n  friendId: 250\n}\n\n{\n  id: '23',\n  attributes: {\n    firstName: 'Bill',\n    lastName: 'Graham'\n  },\n  relationships: {\n    friend: {\n      type: 'person',\n      id: 250\n    }  \n  }\n}\n\n{\n  id: '1586353b-7891-48ef-956a-07ea4d40e98f'\n}\n\nNot all backend services return data that have an ID attribute.

Each of these slices will store information about a single type of\nresource, separate from your other types of resources.\nIn the rest of this guide, we will be talking about the structure of a single\nstate slice. If you're not using combineReducers, then the slice will instead\nbe your entire state tree.\nInitial State\nThe initial state slice has the following shape:\n{\n  resources: {},\n  meta: {},\n  labels: {}\n}\n\nAs you dispatch Action types, Resourceful Redux will make changes to these\nvalues in a predictable way. We will cover what goes inside each of these pieces\nin this guide.\nResources\nAll of your resource data will be available in the state slice's resources\nproperty. This is an object of resources of a single type.\nResourceful Redux enforces a\nnormalized structure to\nyour data: each individual resource can be found in exactly one place in the\nstate tree.\nFor instance, if your server returns the following JSON response body:\n{\n  data: [\n    {\n      id: 23,\n      firstName: 'Sally'\n    },\n    {\n      id: 100,\n      firstName: 'Jane'\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nthen your state slice will end up looking like this:\n{\n  resources: {\n    23: {\n      id: 23,\n      firstName: 'Sally'\n    },\n    100: {\n      id: 100,\n      firstName: 'Jane'\n    }\n  },\n  meta: {\n    // Resource metadata here\n  },\n  labels: {\n    // Request labels here\n  }\n}\n\nThe resources object allows you to quickly look up resources given their ID.\nYou may be wondering how ordering from the server is preserved. You use request\nlabels to do this, which is a concept we will cover shortly.\nKeep in mind that Resourceful Redux doesn't care about the specific format that\nyour server sends the data back in. You just need to make sure that the resources\nyou pass into Resourceful Redux have an id attribute.\nResource Metadata\nMetadata about each of the resources in your state slice's resources array\nis stored under the meta object of the slice. The meta object is similar to\nthe resources object, in that the keys are individual resource IDs.\nMetadata includes information about requests, such as whether the resource is\nbeing updated, or deleted. You can store additional, application-specific\nmetadata here, such as whether or not a resource is \"selected\" in your UI.\nResourceful Redux comes with built-in metadata for each resource, representing\nthe status of any CRUD request related to that resource. This built-in metadata\nlooks like the following:\n{\n  createStatus: 'NULL',\n  readStatus: 'NULL',\n  updateStatus: 'NULL',\n  deleteStatus: 'NULL'\n}\n\nThese four keys represent the four CRUD actions. The values of the keys are\none of the four request statuses – \"NULL\", \"PENDING\", \"SUCCEEDED\", or\n\"FAILED\", representing the status of any requests to CRUD that resource.\nYou're encouraged to store additional, application-specific metadata for your\nresources, too. For instance, a common feature of applications is to allow a\nuser to \"select\" resources, before performing some action on the selection.\nOne thing you could do is store a selected boolean on the metadata, so\nthat it would look like:\n{\n  createStatus: 'NULL',\n  readStatus: 'NULL',\n  updateStatus: 'NULL',\n  deleteStatus: 'NULL',\n  selected: false\n}\n\nLet's look at an example to see how this metadata changes as the user interacts\nwith your application. Consider an application where a user can select resources\nfrom a list, and then take action on their selection (such as updating or\ndeleting the selected items). If the user has selected two resources, with\nIDs 2 and 23, then their state slice will look like the following:\n{\n  resources: [\n    // The resources themselves are in here.\n  ],\n  meta: {\n    2: {\n      selected: true,\n      createStatus: 'NULL',\n      readStatus: 'NULL',\n      updateStatus: 'NULL',\n      deleteStatus: 'NULL'\n    },\n    23: {\n      selected: true,\n      createStatus: 'NULL',\n      readStatus: 'NULL',\n      updateStatus: 'NULL',\n      deleteStatus: 'NULL'\n    },\n    100: {\n      selected: false,\n      createStatus: 'NULL',\n      readStatus: 'NULL',\n      updateStatus: 'NULL',\n      deleteStatus: 'NULL'\n    }\n  },\n  labels: { ... }\n}\n\nIf the user then clicks a \"Delete\" button to initiate the deletion of these\nresources, the slice would then look like this:\n{\n  resources: {\n    // The resources themselves are in here.\n  },\n  meta: {\n    2: {\n      selected: true,\n      createStatus: 'NULL',\n      readStatus: 'NULL',\n      updateStatus: 'NULL',\n      deleteStatus: 'PENDING'\n    },\n    23: {\n      selected: true,\n      createStatus: 'NULL',\n      readStatus: 'NULL',\n      updateStatus: 'NULL',\n      deleteStatus: 'PENDING'\n    },\n    100: {\n      selected: false,\n      createStatus: 'NULL',\n      readStatus: 'NULL',\n      updateStatus: 'NULL',\n      deleteStatus: 'NULL'\n    }\n  },\n  labels: { ... }\n}\n\nAny time that you have metadata associated with a single item, you can add it\nto that resource's meta object to keep track of it.\nKeep in mind that you don't need to store any additional metadata here. For\ninstance, in the above example, if you'd rather have a selectedIds property\ndirectly on your state instead, then you could do that. Just know that\nthe option is there to store your own, additional metadata per-resource within\nmeta.\nLabels\nThe last piece of the slice is called labels. Any time that you initiate a\nCRUD operation request, you can assign it a label. A label is just a string,\nsuch as \"createBook\". Resourceful Redux associates the following data about\nthe request with your label:\n\nwhich resources were returned by the request\nthe status (pending, failed, and so on) of the request\n\nYou might be wondering what labels are for. The Labels guide later on in\nthis documentation is dedicated to answering that question in detail. For now,\nlet's just look at what the structure of the labels is:\n{\n  resources: {\n    // The resources themselves are in here.\n  },\n  meta: {\n    // The resource meta is in here.\n  }\n  labels: {\n    createBook: {\n      ids: [],\n      status: 'PENDING'\n    },\n    shoppingCart: {\n      ids: [1, 20, 53],\n      status: 'SUCCEEDED'\n    },\n    recentBooks: {\n      ids: [20, 71, 100, 102, 103, 120],\n      status: 'SUCCEEDED'\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNow that you know how data is stored, you're ready to start building\nRedux Actions to modify this data.\n"},"docs/guides/crud-actions.html":{"url":"docs/guides/crud-actions.html","title":"CRUD Actions","keywords":"","body":"CRUD Actions\nResourceful Redux exports Action types to help you create, read, update,\nand delete resources.\n\"Start\" and \"end\" Actions\nCRUD operations are usually asynchronous. In Resourceful Redux, these\nasynchronous CRUD operations are represented as a sequence of two Redux Actions.\nFirst, there is a \"start\" action, which updates your store to reflect that the\nCRUD operation is in a \"pending\" state. This is later followed by an end action,\nwhich updates the status to reflect the outcome of the request.\nFor instance, the sequence of action types for a successful read request is the\nfollowing:\nREAD_RESOURCES_PENDING ⇨ READ_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED\nThis notion of a start and end action will continue to be referenced throughout\nthese guides. In particular, remember that the start action sets the request\nstatus to 'PENDING', and that it is dispatched right before the request begins.\nThe redux-thunk middleware is\nrecommended for making action creators for these CRUD operations.\nAction Attributes\nAll actions have a single required value, resourceName, which is the name\nof the resource that is being affected. The simplest action, then, looks\nsomething like this:\nimport { actionTypes } from 'resourceful-redux';\nimport store from './store';\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_PENDING,\n  resourceName: 'books'\n});\n\nThis action type isn't very useful, however. Without more information about this\nrequest, Resourceful Redux doesn't know where to put this information in your\nstate tree. Consequently, this action is a no-op.\nTo reflect a request status in the state tree, you need to supply at least one\nof these two values in your action: a resources array, or a label.\nresources\nA resources array represents the resources being affected by the action.\nIt can be an array if IDs, such as [1, 2, 3], or an array of resource objects,\nsuch as\n[\n  {\n    id: 1,\n    name: 'Brian',\n    phone: '444.444.4444'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 2,\n    name: 'Sarah',\n    phone: '222.222.2222'\n  }\n]\n\nYou can even mix the two. When it comes to a resources array, the important\npart is that the objects have some id. This associates the action with some\nresources.\nYou may be wondering when you might use the object form versus the shorthand\nform. There are two guidelines to remember, one for the start action, and one\nfor the end action.\nFor the start action, provide IDs, if you have them.\nFor the end action, provide the full resource definitions, if you have them.\nIf you don't, but you do have IDs, then provide those.\nLet's look at an example.\nIf you're reading a single resource, such as a book, then you might access that\nbook from your backend service with its ID. In this situation, you will have an\nID at the time that you dispatch the start action, so we include that ID in\nthe action's resources array:\nimport { actionTypes } from 'resourceful-redux';\nimport store from './store';\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_PENDING,\n  resourceName: 'books',\n  resources: [23]\n});\n\nWhen the request succeeds, you now have more detailed information about this\nbook to add to your store. So you would include the full book definition in the\nsuccess action's resources:\nimport { actionTypes } from 'resourceful-redux';\nimport store from './store';\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED,\n  resourceName: 'books',\n  resources: [{\n    id: 23,\n    releaseYear: 2015,\n    author: 'Jane M. Goodfellow',\n    title: 'A History of Canada'\n  }]\n});\n\nWhenever a resources array is supplied, Resourceful Redux will update the\nmeta for each resource in that array.\nThe \"success\" action types also have special behavior with the resources\narray. For creates, reads, and updates, your state's resources object will be\nupdated to reflect any new data. For successful deletes, the state for that\nresource will be changed to be null, and the resource will be removed from the\nids array of all labels.\nIt isn't always possible to provide an array of resources in your action. For\ninstance, if the user is searching for books by entering a title, you couldn't\nknow which books will be returned until after the request has completed.\nTo keep track of the resources for requests like these, you need to use labels.\nlabel\nSupplying a label will track the status of this request under the labels\nproperty of your store. You may also supply resources in your action to\nassociate those specific resources with the label, too.\nFor instance, if your interface allows users to search for a books resource, you\nmight dispatch the following action:\nimport { actionTypes } from 'resourceful-redux';\nimport store from './store';\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_PENDING,\n  resourceName: 'books',\n  label: 'booksSearch',\n  query: 'Lord of the Flies'\n});\n\nLater, when you dispatch the success action, the resources returned will be\nassociated with this label. This will allow you to keep track of which books were\nreturned by this specific search.\nLabels are one of the more difficult features of Resourceful Redux to wrap your\nhead around, so there is an entire guide dedicated\nto explaining how to use them, and when to use them.\nOther CRUD Action properties\nThe following CRUD Action attributes are all optional.\n\nmergeResources (Boolean): When an action results in resources being\nupdated in the store, this determines if the new data is merged with the old,\nor if it replaces the old data. Defaults to true. This only has an effect\non successful read, write, and update Actions.\n\nmergeMeta (Boolean): This is like mergeResources, but for metadata.\nDefaults to true. This property works with actions with any of the CRUD\naction types.\n\nmergeLabelIds (Boolean): When a label is supplied, this lets you control\nwhether or not the new list of IDs replaces or gets merged into the existing\nlist of IDs for that label. When true, it will protect against duplicate\nIDs being added. Defaults to true. This only applies for successful read,\nwrite, and update Actions that have a label specified.\n\n\nAction Creators\nThe core Resourceful Redux library does not include action creators, but there\nis an extension library for action creators.\nYou're also free to build your own action creators. For examples, refer to the\nfour CRUD guides:\n\nReading Resources\nUpdating Resources\nCreating Resources\nDeleting Resources\n\nUsing the Action Types\nOne of this library's exports are these CRUD action types. You can use them in\nyour application by importing them like so:\nimport { actionTypes } from 'resourceful-redux';\n\nFor a complete list of all of the action types, refer to the\nAction Types API Reference.\n"},"docs/guides/tracking-requests.html":{"url":"docs/guides/tracking-requests.html","title":"Tracking Requests","keywords":"","body":"Tracking Requests\nDisplaying feedback about CRUD operations requires knowing the status of its\nrequest: is it pending, failing, succeeded? This is what we mean by \"tracking\"\na request. The status of a request can be used to display feedback to the user\nof your application, such as showing loading indicators or error messages.\nThere are two ways to track CRUD operation requests in Resourceful Redux:\ntracking the status on some resources' metadata, and using a labeled request.\nYou'll always use at least one of these when performing CRUD operations.\nSometimes, you might use both.\nResource Metadata\nSome CRUD operations directly target a resource, or a set of resources, by their\nID. For instance, if the user is fetching a book with ID 23, then this action is\ndirectly targeting the book with ID of 23. Likewise, deleting books with IDs\n100, 101, and 102 is a request that is targeting these three resources directly.\nAnytime that you have a set of IDs when the action begins, you have the option\nto track the CRUD operation status on the targeted resource's metadata. You can\ndo this by passing a resources array with the start action.\nLet's look at an example. The action that represents beginning a read request\nof a book with ID 24 looks like the following:\n{\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_PENDING,\n  resourceName: 'books',\n  resources: [24]\n}\n\nWhen this is dispatched, your slice's metadata will be updated like this:\n{\n  meta: {\n    24: {\n      createStatus: 'NULL',\n      readStatus: 'PENDING',\n      updateStatus: 'NULL',\n      deleteStatus: 'NULL'\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nIn your view layer, you can then use\ngetStatus to access this state in a\nconvenient way.\nThe rule of thumb is:\nYou can track CRUD operation requests on resource metadata anytime you have an\nID when you fire the \"start\" action type.\nThe above condition isn't always met. In those situations, you use request\nlabels to track requests.\nRequest Labels\nA request label is a name that you give an individual request. You can use\nlabels to track the status of any CRUD operation request in your application,\nwhether or not you have IDs at the start of the action.\nThe following information is stored about each labeled request in your state\nslice:\n{\n  status: 'NULL',\n  ids: []\n}\n\nwhere status is the request status, and ids are any associated resource IDs\nwith this request.\nInformation about labeled requests is stored in the labels section of your\nstate slice. For instance, if you dispatch a pending action for a request with\nthe label create, then your state slice would look like:\n{\n  resources: {\n    // resources in here\n  },\n  meta: {\n    // resource metadata in here\n  },\n  labels: {\n    create: {\n      status: 'PENDING',\n      ids: []\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nYou can use getStatus to conveniently\naccess and use the status of a labeled request in your view layer.\nTwo common examples of when to use a label include:\n\nRead many requests, where the user is passing some sort of query to filter a\nlarge list by\n\nCreating requests, when the user does not provide an ID for the new resource\n\n\nbut do note that they can be used for any CRUD operation, even when IDs are\nincluded in the start action.\nIt might seem strange to associate a name with a request, but we find that it\nworks out well in practice. For instance, for creating a book, you might use the\nlabel \"create\" or \"createBook\". And for fetching the latest movies, you\nmight use \"latestMovies\". It turns out that there's usually a label that makes\nsense for each request in your application.\nLabels have other uses aside from request tracking. The next guide on\nRequest Labels covers the other use cases.\nUsing Statuses\nYou now know the two locations that request statuses can be stored. There is a\nseparate guide on using Request Statuses in\nyour view layer.\n"},"docs/guides/request-labels.html":{"url":"docs/guides/request-labels.html","title":"Request Labels","keywords":"","body":"Request Labels\nA label is a name that you give to an individual CRUD operation request.\nLabeling a request is a simple idea, but it's a powerful feature that has\nseveral uses in Resourceful Redux.\nWhat is a Label\nA label is a word that you associate with a request. For instance, if you're\ncreating a book, you might use the label \"create\". In your store slice,\neach label is found under the labels key. In the example of create, a\nslice might look like:\n{\n  labels: {\n    create: {\n      status: 'SUCCEEDED',\n      ids: [24]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nwhich would mean that the create request succeeded, and the resource with ID\nof 24 was created.\nWhy label a request\nThere are three common reasons to label a request in Resourceful Redux:\n\nThey can be used to track a request, even when you don't have resource ID(s)\nwhen you dispatch the start action\n\nThey can be used to keep track of server-side ordering of your requests\n\nThey can be used to keep track of subsets of a resource\n\n\nLet's go into more detail about when you may need to do one of these things.\nTracking CRUD Operation Requests\nTracking a request means being able to look up its current status. Is it in\nflight, has it failed, or did it succeed?\nLabeling your equest can be used to track requests. For more, refer to the\nTracking Requests guide.\nServer-side Ordering\nIn your state slice, your resources aren't stored in any order: they're just\nkeys on the resources object. Frequently, applications will need to preserve\nthe order that the server returns a list of resources in. For instance, if you\nmake a request for a list of books based on popularity.\nLabels keep an array of IDs of resources that are associated with the request,\nso they can be used to preserve this sort order.\nWhen the request to retrieve the most popular books succeeds, your state slice\nmay look like something like:\n{\n  resources: {\n    // Resources and their attributes are in here\n  },\n  meta: {\n    // Metadata about resources is stored in here\n  },\n  labels: {\n    create: {\n      popularBooks: 'SUCCEEDED',\n      ids: [1002, 24, 100, 234]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nOrdered Subsets of Resources\nIn the earlier guide on State Structure, we\ncovered that all resources of the same type are kept in a single object. This is\na good thing, but it introduces a problem: how do you keep track of \"groups\" of\nthe same resource? Consider a web application shows a list of recently released\nbooks, as well as a user's shopping cart of books. We know that in the state\ntree, all of these books will be stored in one object, but we will want to show\nthem as two different lists in the interface. How can we do that?\nThe solution relies on the fact that these \"groupings\" of resources are nearly\nalways determined by different network requests. For instance, you might make one\nrequest to get the recently released books, then a second request for the\nshopping cart. By keeping track of which resources were returned for each\nrequest, you can keep track of the different books.\nAnd that's exactly what labels are: they're a name that you give to individual\nrequests. Resourceful Redux keeps track of the resources returned by each\nlabelled request.\nUsing a label\nUsing a label is straightforward: add the label property to the\nAction types of a CRUD operation.\nimport { actionTypes } fom 'resourceful-redux';\nimport store from './store';\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_PENDING,\n  resourceName: 'books',\n  label: 'search'\n});\n\nWhen to Use labels\nA rule of thumb for using labels is:\nUse a label anytime that you do not have an ID, or a list of IDs, when you\ndispatch a \"pending\" action.\nFor example, if you attempt to read a book with ID of 23, then you will have\nan ID when you dispatch the \"read pending\" action (the ID is 23). So a\nlabel may not be necessary in this situation.\nOn the other hand, if you were to make a request to your backend for the list\nof books that were just released this past week, then you wouldn't have any IDs\nat the time that you dispatch the \"read pending\" action. So you should use a\nlabel in this situation.\nYou're free to use a label in addition to passing IDs, too. Many applications\nwon't need to do this, but the option is there if you need it. If you're just\nstarting out with Resourceful Redux, we recommend sticking with the rule of\nthumb.\nAn Example\nWhen a label is used, the status of the associated request is stored in your\nstate, and you can access it with\ngetStatus:\nimport { getStatus } from 'resourceful-redux';\nimport store from './store';\n\nconst state = store.getState();\nconst searchStatus = getStatus(state, 'books.labels.search.status');\n// => Returns the following object:\n//\n// {\n//   null: false,\n//   pending: true,\n//   failed: false,\n//   succeeded: false\n// }\n//\n\nWhen the request succeeds, you dispatch the following action:\nimport { actionTypes } fom 'resourceful-redux';\nimport store from './store';\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED,\n  resourceName: 'books',\n  label: 'search',\n  // `newResources` are the list of books that were returned by the server\n  // for this query.\n  resources: newResources\n});\n\nNow when you call getStatus for this label, you get the following object:\n{\n  pending: false,\n  failed: false,\n  succeeded: true\n}\n\nAdditionally, the resources associated with the label are available under its\nids attribute. You can use this array to filter the resources list by the\nlabel, or you can use the getResources helper method.\nimport { getResources } from 'resourceful-redux';\nimport store from './store';\n\nconst state = store.getState();\n\nconst searchedBooks = getResources(state, 'books', 'search');\n\nReplacing Label IDs\nBy default, subsequent successful requests with the same label will merge\nthe old label IDs with the new. You can outright replace the old list with the\nnew by passing mergeLabelIds: false in your action. For instance:\nimport { actionTypes } fom 'resourceful-redux';\nimport store from './store';\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED,\n  resourceName: 'books',\n  label: 'search',\n  mergeLabelIds: false,\n  // `newResources` are the list of books that were returned by the server\n  // for this query.\n  resources: newResources\n});\n\n"},"docs/guides/request-statuses.html":{"url":"docs/guides/request-statuses.html","title":"Request Statuses","keywords":"","body":"Request Statuses\nWe now know that when the CRUD action types are dispatched, Resourceful Redux\nwill set some metadata about those requests for us in the store. In this guide,\nwe will cover how you can use this state in your view layer.\nIn these examples, we will be writing React components using react-redux. Do\nkeep in mind that nothing in Resourceful requires React: if you're using Redux\nwith any other view layer, then this library will work just as well.\ngetStatus\nOne of the exports of this library is\ngetStatus. This function facilitates\nusing Resourceful Redux data to build your interfaces, and for this reason it\nwill likely be the function of Resourceful Redux that you use the most.\nLet's look at an example. Let's say we have a page that displays details about\na book. We might write the following component:\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux';\nimport { getStatus } from 'resourceful-redux';\n\nexport class BookDetails extends Component {\n  render() {\n    const { book, readStatus } = this.props;\n\n    return (\n      \n        {readStatus.pending && 'Loading...'}\n        {readStatus.failed && 'There was an error.'}\n        {readStatus.succeeded && (\n          \n            \n              {book.title} ({book.id})\n            \n            \n              {book.releaseYear}, {book.author}\n            \n          \n        )}\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nfunction mapStateToProps(state, props) {\n  // A user can pass a `bookId` into this Component to view the book's data\n  const bookId = props.bookId;\n  const readStatus = getStatus(state, `books.meta.${bookId}.readStatus`, true);\n  const book = state.books.resources.find(book => book.id === bookId);\n\n  return {\n    book,\n    readStatus\n  };\n}\n\nexport default connect(mapStateToProps)(BookDetails);\n\nYou can see how the object returned from getStatus makes a render function\nvery expressive. It's also convenient that there aren't any checks for\nexistence here, even though our data is nested in our store: the API of\nResourceful Redux provides you with very predictable data.\nAggregating Statuses\nOften times, the data displayed on a single page comes from multiple sources.\nWhenever possible, we recommend using multiple getStatus calls in these\nsituations, so that you can display information to the user as it becomes\navailable. This way, if one endpoint is slow, or if the request fails entirely,\nthe rest of the interface isn't affected by it.\nWith that said, we know this isn't always possible. Sometimes, you simply\ndo need to wait for multiple requests to resolve before there is anything\nuseful to show on the page.\nYou can use getStatus to aggregate these calls together into status. The\nAPI for this is as follows:\nimport { getStatus } from 'resourceful-redux';\nimport store from './get-store';\n\nconst state = store.getState();\n\nconst aggregatedStatus = getStatus(state, [\n  'books.meta.23.readStatus',\n  'books.labels.bookComments.status'\n], true);\n\nThe rules of aggregation work as follows:\n\nIf any status is failed: true, then the group is failed: true.\nIf no status is failed: true, but at least one is pending: true, then the\ngroup is pending: true.\nIf all statuses are succeeded: true, then the group is\nsucceeded: true.\n\nAt most, only one of these values will ever be true.\nIf treatNullAsPending (the third argument, see below) is false, then all three\nvalues will be false if all of the request statuses in the state tree are\n\"NULL\".\ntreatNullAsPending\nThe third argument to getStatus is a Boolean called treatNullAsPending. It\ndetermines whether a request status of \"NULL\" will count as pending or not.\nConsider an interface that loads a particular book when the page loads. Right\nat page load, there will always be a short moment when the request hasn't begun,\nyet your store has been set up. At this moment, the request status for this read\nwill have a value of \"NULL\".\nIf you don't pass true, then there will be a \"flash of no content\" unless\nyou explicitly check for the \"NULL\" status yourself. To avoid this, pass\ntreatNullAsPending as true, and getStatus will instead consider that to be a\npending state.\nThe default value of treatNullAsPending is false.\nThe Rule of Thumb\nThere is a rule of thumb for using treatNullAsPending:\n\nFor requests that happen when the page loads, pass treatNullAsPending as true\nFor requests that happen as a response to a user's action (such as clicking a\nbutton), pass treatNullAsPending as false\n\n"},"docs/guides/reading-resources.html":{"url":"docs/guides/reading-resources.html","title":"Reading Resources","keywords":"","body":"Reading Resources\nResourceful Redux provides four action types for\nreading resources. They are as follows:\n\"READ_RESOURCES_PENDING\"\n\"READ_RESOURCES_FAILED\"\n\"READ_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED\"\n\"READ_RESOURCES_NULL\"\n\nEach request will always begin with an action with type\nREAD_RESOURCES_PENDING. Then, one of the other three action types will be\nused to represent the resolution of that request. Use the requests in the\nfollowing way:\n\nREAD_RESOURCES_FAILED: Use this if the request fails for any reason. This\ncould be network errors, or any\nHTTP Status Code\ngreater than 400.\nREAD_RESOURCES_NULL: Use this is the request is aborted.\nREAD_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED: Use this when the request was successful.\n\nUsing Labels\nWhen reading a single resource, you usually use an ID to read it. Therefore,\nlabels aren't usually needed for single reads, as you can track the request\non the resource's metadata directly.\nFor bulk reads, you sometimes use some sort of filter or query to retrieve a\nlist of resources. In these situations, it's often a good idea to use a label\nto keep track of the request.\nSuccessful Reads\nWhen an action of type READ_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED is dispatched, the\nreducer will update any of the resources in your state tree with the ones\nincluded in the action's resources.\nThe metadata for each of those resources will also be changed to have\nreadStatus: 'SUCCEEDED'.\nIf a label is passed, then the IDs for the label will be updated to include\nthe new IDs.\nAction Creators\nThe Action Creators extension provides\nout-of-the-box action creators that you can use to read resources.

Use plugins to:\n\nAdd support for custom action types\nAdd or change the way the reducer responds to the built-in action types\n\nWriting a Plugin\nWriting a plugin is very similar to writing a reducer. Plugins are functions\nthat have the following signature: (state, action, options), where state is\nthe current state, action is the action that was dispatched, and options are\nthe options that were passed into\nresourceReducer.\nA plugin must always return the new state.\nBecause a plugin is intended to be generic, you will often wrap your plugins\nin a function that you call with the resource that the plugin is for. This\nlets you scope the plugin to a specific resource. Otherwise, any time that you\nfire a particular Action type, all of the resources in your state tree would\nbe affected!\nCustom Action Types\nLet's build a plugin that lets a user select resources from a list. The code\nfor this plugin looks like this:\nimport { setResourceMeta } from 'resourceful-redux';\nimport myActionTypes from './my-action-types';\n\nexport default function(resourceName) {\n  return function(state, action, options) {\n    // Ignore actions that were dispatched for another resource type\n    if (action.resourceName !== resourceName) {\n      return state;\n    }\n\n    if (action.type === myActionTypes.SELECT_RESOURCES) {\n      return {\n        ...state,\n        meta: setResourceMeta({\n          resources: action.resources,\n          meta: state.meta,\n          newMeta: {\n            selected: true\n          },\n          initialResourceMeta: options.initialResourceMeta\n        })\n      };\n    } else if (action.type === myActionTypes.UNSELECT_RESOURCES) {\n      return {\n        ...state,\n        meta: setResourceMeta({\n          resources: action.resources,\n          meta: state.meta,\n          newMeta: {\n            selected: false\n          },\n          initialResourceMeta: options.initialResourceMeta\n        })\n      };\n    } else {\n      return state;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nYou would then use this plugin like so:\nimport { createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux';\nimport { resourceReducer } from 'resourceful-redux';\nimport selectResources from './plugins/select-resources';\n\nlet store = createStore(\n  combineReducers({\n    books: resourceReducer('books', {\n      plugins: [\n        selectResources('books')\n      ]\n    }),\n  })\n);\n\nChanging Built-In Action Type behavior\nPlugins are run after the built-in reducer code runs, so you can write\nplugins that affect the way the reducer transforms the state for built-in action\ntypes. In the following plugin, we set a property on the store anytime a\nsuccessful read occurs:\nexport default function(resourceName) {\n  return function(state, action, options) {\n    // Only take action if the resource name of the Action matches the\n    // resource this plugin is registered for\n    if (action.resourceName !== resourceName) {\n      return state;\n    }\n\n    if (action.type === 'READ_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED') {\n      return {\n        ...state,\n        readSucceeded: true\n      };\n    } else {\n      return state;\n    }\n  };\n}\n\nBest Practices\nBecause plugins are so similar to reducers, you can use a switch statement\nand support multiple action types within each plugin. This is usually a\ngood thing, but be mindful of keeping each plugin limited to a single\nresponsibility.\nFor example, in the above example of a plugin for selecting resources, it\nsupports two Action types – one for selection, and one for deselection. This\nplugin encapsulates that one responsibility, and it isn't responsible for any\nother Action types.\nWe recommend having a plugin for each distinct responsibility.\n"},"docs/recipes/":{"url":"docs/recipes/","title":"Recipes","keywords":"","body":"Recipes\nThese are patterns and snippets of code that will help you when using\nResourceful Redux in an application.

One feature of HTTP\nrequests is that they can be cancelled.\nAs a rule of thumb, for each request that you make in your application, there\nwill always be one situation where you will want to cancel that request to\nprevent bugs.\nWhy do it\nCanceling requests prevents race conditions. A race condition occurs when you\nhave two requests in flight at the same time, but your code is written such that\none must resolve before the other. As you may know, requests can resolve\nin any order, which leads to the bugs.\nA common pattern we've seen in Redux applications is this:\n\nwhenever a request completes, an action is dispatched\na reducer responds to that action, updating the state\na view renders using the latest data from the state\n\nThis pattern isn't bad – it's great! You just need to be aware that\nit can lead to bugs when requests aren't cancelled.\nLet's look at two examples that demonstrate the problem.\nExample: A Typehead\nConsider a \"typeahead\" component that allows a user to type to search for books.\nEven when the user's input is debounced, there are situations where two (or more)\nactive requests can be in flight. The user can type, wait a moment for a request\nto send, then type one key to fire off a second request. If the backend response\ntime is slower than the debounce time, then two search requests will be in\nflight at once.\nBecause the requests can complete in any order, it is possible that the user's\nearliest search results will return after their latest search results. If\nyour code is written such that the last-received search results are displayed,\nthen that can lead to the wrong search results being shown.\nCanceling a previous request resolves this problem, as it means that only one\nsearch request will ever be in flight at a time, and it will be the user's most\nrecent search. If you're using an action creator that returns a native\nXMLHttpRequest object, such as the action creators in the Action Creators\nextension, then your code may look like this:\nclass Typeahead extends Component {\n  searchBooks: function(query) {\n    if (this.searchBooksRequest) {\n      this.searchBooksRequest.abort();\n    }\n\n    this.searchBooksRequest = this.props.searchBooks(query);\n  }\n}\n\nAnother tip is to cancel any requests when the component unmounts. If the search\nresults aren't needed when the component unmounts, then letting a request complete\nwill still update your state tree, which can cause unnecessary renders in your\napplication. Canceling requests in componentWillUnmount might look something\nlike:\nclass Typeahead extends Component {\n  componentWillUnmount: function() {\n    if (this.searchBooksRequest) {\n      this.searchBooksRequest.abort();\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nExample: Pagination\nConsider a page of an application that displays books. Often, long lists of\nresources will be paginated, and a user can move between the pages by clicking a\n\"next\" or \"previous\" button.\nA race condition can occur when the user clicks the buttons too fast, or when\nthe backend service is slow. If your view layer renders out the results of the\nlatest response, then it's possible that they could see the results from the\nwrong page.\nSimilar to the search example above, ensuring that only a single page of data\nis being fetched at once is the solution.\nThe solution is the same as the typeahead example:\n\ncancel any existing page-change requests before starting a new one\nconsider if it makes sense to cancel the request when the component\nunmounts\n\nA common feature of these bugs is that they depend on unreliable network\nconditions, so they don't usually come up in a development environment. This\nmakes them easy to ignore, but they're still worth protecting against.\nHow to do it\nThere are many different tools developers use to make requests. In this section,\nwe will go through how to cancel requests using some of the most common tools.\nXMLHttpRequest\nIn browsers, the native way to cancel a request is to call the abort method\non an XMLHttpRequest.\nconst myRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();\nmyRequest.open('GET', 'books');\n\nmyRequest.abort();\n\nxhr\nThe xhr library simplifies the creation of\nXHR objects. Because it returns a native XMLHttpRequest object, canceling\nrequests with xhr is the same as when you use the native XMLHttpRequest\nconstructor.\nimport xhr from 'xhr';\n\nconst request = xhr.get('/books/23', (err, res) => {\n  if (req.aborted) {\n    console.log('Request cancelled');\n  }\n});\n\nrequest.abort();\n\nThe Action Creators extension for Resourceful\nRedux uses xhr for requests. The action creators in that extension return a\nnative XHR object, so you can use the abort method to cancel those requests.\nfetch\nThe native fetch\nmethod is a tool for making requests that returns a\nPromise.\nNative Promises cannot be cancelled, so we do not recommend using fetch with\nResourceful Redux.\naxios\naxios is a Promise-based approach to HTTP\nrequests that supports cancellation. It uses a system of canceling Promises\ncalled \"Cancel Tokens,\" which is based off of\na withdrawn cancelable Promises proposal.\nTo see how to cancel axios requests, refer to\nthe axios documentation.\nBluebird\nBluebird is Promise implementation that supports\ncancellation using an onCancel method.\nRefer to the Bluebird documentation\nfor specifics on the onCancel method.\nRxJS Observables\nRxJS Observables are another tool that can be used to make HTTP requests. The\ntakeUntil\nmethod can be used to cancel RxJS requests.\nIf you happen to be using redux-observable, refer to that library's documentation\nfor\na recipe for request cancellation.\nAlternatives\nYou don't always need to cancel requests. Two other options are:\n\nPrevent the user from performing an action more than once. For instance, in\nthe search example, you could prevent the user from typing if a search of theirs\nis already in flight. And in the pagination example, you can disable the\n\"next\" and \"previous\" buttons until the new page loads. In these examples,\nthis approach is clearly a subpar experience, but sometimes it does make\nsense. For instance, disabling a \"Delete\" button for a book once the user\nclicks it once, or disabling a \"Buy\" button after the user confirms a\npurchase.\n\nYou could write code to keep track of which request's response is the correct\none to display. We generally find it to be simpler to cancel requests instead.\n\n\nThere may be other options, too, and different approaches may make more sense to\nyou based on the situation.\n"},"docs/recipes/unauthorized-responses.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/unauthorized-responses.html","title":"Unauthorized Responses","keywords":"","body":"Unauthorized Responses\nSome applications log users out after a certain period of time. For single page\napps, this usually presents itself as requests to the backend suddenly failing\nfor the logged-out user. This can occur when the user leaves the application\nopen in their browser over night, for instance.\nA common UX pattern is to display a notification to the user when this occurs,\nso that they can log back in. This recipe describes one way that you can detect\nwhen a user is logged out, so that you can notify them however you see fit.\nYour server\nThe backend that you interface with needs to provide a consistent representation\nof the user being logged out.\nIf your API uses proper\nHTTP status codes,\nthen this means that the responses will have a 401 status code.\nThe rest of this guide will assume that the backend returns a 401 HTTP status\ncode, although this same system works for other representations, too.\nAction Creators\nWhenever an unauthorized response from the backend is returned in your CRUD\naction creators, include the status code in the action that you dispatch.\nIf you're using the Action Creators extension,\nthen the entire res object will be attached to the action. You can access the\nstatus code at action.res.statusCode.\nIf you're not using the Action Creators extension, then your code may look\nsomething like:\nexport function readBook(id) {\n  return function(dispatch) {\n    dispatch({\n      type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_PENDING,\n      resourceName: 'books',\n      resources: [id]\n    });\n\n    request('/some-url', (err, res) => {\n      if (err || res.statusCode >= 400) {\n        dispatch({\n          type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_FAILED,\n          resourceName: 'books',\n          resources: [id],\n          res\n        });\n\n        return;\n      }\n\n      // Check to see if the request was cancelled, or if it succeeded, then\n      // dispatch the appropriate action here.\n    });\n  }\n}\n\nReducer\nThe final step is to write a reducer that updates the state tree whenever\nthese failed actions occur. Here is an example reducer that does this:\nimport { actionTypes } from 'resourceful-redux';\n\nconst {\n  READ_RESOURCES_FAILED,\n  UPDATE_RESOURCES_FAILED,\n  CREATE_RESOURCES_FAILED,\n  DELETE_RESOURCES_FAILED\n} = actionTypes;\n\nexport default function reducer(state = false, action) {\n  const isFailedAction = action.type === READ_RESOURCES_FAILED ||\n    action.type === UPDATE_RESOURCES_FAILED ||\n    action.type === CREATE_RESOURCES_FAILED ||\n    action.type === DELETE_RESOURCES_FAILED;\n\n  if (isFailedAction && action.res.statusCode === 401) {\n    return true;\n  }\n\n  return state;\n}\n\nBefore an unauthorized response has been received, this reducer will return\na state of false.  When a logged-out response is received, then the reducer\nwill update the state to be true.\nYou'll want to use this reducer with\ncombineReducers:\nimport { combineReducers } from 'redux';\nimport unauthorizedReducer from './unauthorized-reducer';\n\nconst reducer = combineReducers({\n  unauthorized: unauthorizedReducer,\n  // ...other store slices (your resource reducers, etc.)\n});\n\nWith this in place, you have a slice of your state tree that will be true\nwhenever an unauthorized response is received.\nYou can use this value in your view layer to toggle the appearance of a modal,\nor some other notification, to let the user know that they need to log back in.\n"},"docs/extensions/":{"url":"docs/extensions/","title":"Extensions","keywords":"","body":"Extensions\nExtensions are optional bits of code that make working with Resourceful Redux\neven better.\nWhen you install the resourceful-redux npm package, we include all these\nextensions as separate modules within that package.

It is a thin wrapper around the\nlibrary xhr, and supports all of the same\noptions and signatures.\nOn top of that, it adds two features:\n\nSupport for a qs option (similar to the request library).\n\nOmitting the callback will return a native\nPromise.\n\n\nExample\nimport { xhr } from 'resourceful-redux/action-creators';\n\nconst booksSearch = xhr.get('/books', {\n  // Pass a `qs` option, and it will be stringified and appended to the URL\n  // for you\n  qs: {\n    bookName: 'brilliance of the moon'\n  },\n  json: true\n}, (err, res, body) => {\n  console.log('Got some books', body);\n});\n\n// Later, you can abort the request:\nbooksSearch.abort();\n\n// Omit a callback to get a native Promise. This can be useful sometimes, but the\n// tradeoff is that you cannot cancel Promises.\nxhr.get('/books/24')\n  .then(\n    (res) => console.log('got a book', res),\n    (err) => console.log('there was an error', err)\n  );\n\n"},"docs/faq/":{"url":"docs/faq/","title":"FAQ","keywords":"","body":"FAQ\n\nGeneral\nState Tree\nActions\n\n"},"docs/faq/general.html":{"url":"docs/faq/general.html","title":"General","keywords":"","body":"General FAQ\nWhen should I use Resourceful Redux?\nIf you feel that you're writing too much boilerplate when using Redux by itself,\nthen it might be worth giving a library like Resourceful Redux a try. There are\nsimilar projects that also aim to\nreduce Redux boilerplate, which are also worth your consideration.\nDoes this only work with React?\nNo. The only requirement is that you are using Redux, or a library that has a\nsimilar API to Redux.\nHow does this library handle immutable state?\nThis library uses shallow cloning for state tree updates. This has worked well\nfor us, even on medium-to-large sized applications.\nResourceful Redux does not work well with libraries like\nImmutable.js, although we're open\nto adding support for Immutable if it doesn't bloat the library too much. If\nthis is something you're interested in,\nopen an issue and we\ncan talk more about it.\nDoes this only work with APIs that return data in a specific format?\nNo, this library is agnostic to the format that you receive data in. The only\nrequirement is that each resource that you pass into this library has an id\nattribute.\nWe understand that not every system stores its resources with an id attribute.\nFor instance, if you're working with a books resource, then it might instead\nhave an id attribute called bookId. In these situations, you will need to\nwrite a transform that maps that key to be id instead.\nFor more, refer to the Resources guide.\nDoes this work with a backend that adheres to a well-defined format, such as JSON API?\nYes, it does. You may want to write a plugin to handle\nsome advanced features provided by specifications such as JSON API, such as rich\nrelationship support.\nDoes this work with backends that are not strictly \"RESTful\"?\nYes. The only requirement is that the data returned can be reasonably mapped to\nthe concept of a \"resource.\" A resource, from this library's perspective, is\na JavaScript object with an id attribute.\nFor more on this, refer to the Resources guide.\n"},"docs/faq/state-tree.html":{"url":"docs/faq/state-tree.html","title":"State Tree","keywords":"","body":"State tree\nCan I store additional metadata for resources within meta?\nYou can, and we encourage it.

The only requirement is that you don't change the structure of the\nstate that you start out with: make sure that resources remains an Array,\nand that meta and labels remain Objects. If you stick with that, then you\nshouldn't run into any issues.\nAs a convention, we recommend only storing data relevant to the resource in the\nslice. Use another slice for other information.\nCan I store more than one resource per state slice?\nWe don't recommend doing this right now, but that's just because the library\nisn't built to support it.

The\ncomplete object is shown below:\n{\n  NULL: 'NULL',\n  PENDING: 'PENDING',\n  FAILED: 'FAILED',\n  SUCCEEDED: 'SUCCEEDED',\n}\n\nExample\nimport { requestStatuses } from 'resourceful-redux';\nimport store from './store';\n\nconst state = store.getState();\n\nif (state.books.meta['23'] === requestStatuses.PENDING) {\n  console.log('A book with id \"23\" is in progress.');\n}\n\nTips\n\nAlthough this object can be used to check the status of a request in your\nview layer, it's often more convenient to use getStatus\nfor that purpose. For this reason, we recommend restricting your usage of this\nobject to plugins, reducers, or action creators.\n\n"}}}
